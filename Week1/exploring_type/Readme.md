# Exploring Type

    1. DECLARE a VARIABLE of certain TYPE it can only hold a VALUES of that TYPE
    
    2. var z int = 21
        a) package scope

    3. Primitive Data Type:
        1) In computer science, primitive data type is either of the following 
            a). a basic type : it is a data type provided by a programming language a basic  building block. Most languages allow more complicated composite types to construct
            starting from basic type
            
            b). a built-in type: It is a data type for which the programming language provides
                a built-in support

         2) In most programming languages, all basic data types are built-in. In addition many languages also provide a set of composite data types.Opinions vary as to whether a built-in type that is not basic should be considered "primitive"

    4) Composite data types:
            In computer science, a composite data type or compound data type is any data type 
            which can be constructed in a programming using the primitive data type and other composite type. It is sometime called a structure or aggregate data type, although the latter term may also refereed arrays,list,struct etc.
            ** The act of constructing a composite type is known as composition
